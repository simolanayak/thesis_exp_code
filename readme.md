# Effects of Network Structure on Languages of Contact in a Multiagent Setting: Experimental Code

## Design

### Experimental Configurations

Each experimental configuration will be written in YAML format, with the following parameters:

* Connectivity
* TBD
* Enable Only Prior Contact
* Max Degree (small-world)
* Stop Iterated Learning Early
* Stability Metric

#### Sparse/Scale-Free:

#### Small-world:

#### Fully-Connected:

## Use

### Exporting experimental configs passed in:
