Multiagent Community Experiment Toolkit (Augmentation of EGG) multiagentcrowd
=======================================

This toolkit augments Facebook's EGG library to conduct and analyze experiments for multiagent communities- essentially the tools needed to make a leap from two agents (company) to three or more agents (crowd). As of this writing (March 8th, 2021), this toolkit supplies default architectures for the communication games and focuses on distributions of mutual intelligibility, dialect continuua, diglossia, dialects, etc. 

There are two options for dialect measuring: 

*Mutual intelligibility
*Similarity
